The Global Heat Resilience Service is designed to empower urban decision-makers with the comprehensive data needed to prioritize and tackle this issue effectively. Our platform seamlessly integrates existing open global data, providing detailed neighborhood-level insights into heat vulnerability. It captures key factors such as demographics, socio-economic status, and access to essential services, which traditional methods often overlook. With our user-friendly interface, information that was once inaccessible and fragmented is now consolidated and easily navigable. The Global Heat Resilience Service offers a robust combination of hazard, exposure, and vulnerability data, enabling users to assess heat vulnerability under both current and future climatic conditions. Our clear maps and data visualizations highlight the location and number of people exposed and vulnerable, detailing impacts on health, economic losses, and more. By presenting these insights in an accessible format, the Global Heat Resilience Service supports cities in making informed decisions and implementing effective strategies to protect their communities from the growing threat of extreme heat. Join us in building more resilient urban environments and safeguarding the well-being of residents worldwide.")
